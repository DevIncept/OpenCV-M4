## Pedestrian Detection OpenCV

- Starting with Pedestrian Detection using Opnen CV you can refer [this][link1] article.
- From the provided link there is full explanation with the code which can be downloaded. 

## Car Detection OpenCV

- We then continue with car detection suing OpneCV. Here we would be using pre- trained classifier to detect the vehicles.
- Some articles which could be referred are [first][link2], [second][link1]


### Here is a GitHub [Repo][link4] from where you could get the complete code and also a awesome explaination. 
- This repo belongs to [Aditya Yogish Pai][link5]


## You could go through all the articles and and the repo provided and try to understand the structure of the code.
